/*
 * Switch between using TLS certificate optimization and not
 * This optimization option moves the certificate from .data section to .text section
 *   Thus allowing more data memory (but program memory increases)
 *   When using RootCA, the certificate optimization is really helpful
 *   The RootCA, device certificate and private key will be moved to
 *   .txt (program memory) instead of .data (data memory)
 *   That is an estimate of 4.5kb of memory
 *   We have already 60-75kb of program memory but not enough data memory.
 *   So this provides a balanced memory headroom (both program memory and data memory) for sensor integration.
 * Certificates should be stored in the certificates folder
 *   with the filenames: ca.crt, cert.crt and cert.key
 *   These certificates are compiled using USE_CERTIFICATE_OPTIMIZATION.bat
 *     which is called in the Pre-build step in the "Build Steps" tab in (Properties / C/C++ Build / Settings)
 *   These certificates are then linked to the binary by adding the object files in
 *     FT9XX GCC Linker/Miscellaneous/Other objects of "Tool Settings" tab in (Properties / C/C++ Build / Settings)
 * Alternatively, the certificates can be hardcoded in iot_clientcredential.h
 *   by setting IOT_CONFIG_USE_CERT_OPTIMIZATION to 0 in iot_config.h
